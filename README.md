Estimation of CRM uncertainty associated with stability
== 
The uncertainties are estimated based on the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method using Linear Mixed Effect models (LMEs).
## Features
* Estimates uncertainty associacted with stability for a single analyte at a single temperature.
* The LME accounts for between unit and between run variances and incorporates analytical trend if significant.
* Efficiently handles partially or fully nested and crossed models.
* Estimates uncertainty associacted with homogeneity based on the stability data.
* The data table can be updated with post certification monitoring data that allows the calculation of more precise u_stab estimates and the revision of certified values if needed
